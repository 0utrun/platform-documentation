# Introduction

Thanks for checking out CORE! We know learning how to use an editor can be a daunting task, but we are here to help make it as simple as possible.

If you are a complete beginner just continue by pressing the next arrow in the
bottom right to move to the next section.
If you are coming from another editor, feel free to jump directly to our primer on that.

!!! info
    The sections here are intentionally kept very brief and easily skimmable, but
    future categories have far more details.
