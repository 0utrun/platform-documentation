# Introduction

Thanks for checking out CORE! We know learning how to use an editor can be a daunting task, but we are here to help make it as simple as possible.

If you are a complete beginner we recommend you check out the editor manual and scripting sections that are next, followed by the basic game.
If you are coming from another editor, check out our primer on that.

The sections here are intentionally kept very brief and easily skimmable, for more details look at the `detail` sections in each.
