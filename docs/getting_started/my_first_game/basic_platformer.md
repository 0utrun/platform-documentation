Basic Platformer
================
WIP:

![Layout](../../img/platformer/HierarchySetup.png)

Here we will create a basic game

It will look like `this(TODO)` at the end

At the end of each segment is a link to the source code, as well as a zip of the project at that
time, so you can always ensure you are on the right track.

Will need to explain the reasoning for organization, with containerization for quick lookups rather
than find_by_id or find_by_name.
