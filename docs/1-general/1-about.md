Introduction
============

Welcome to the official documentation of CORE, the
community-focused game creation tool!

This page aims at giving a broad presentation of the engine and of the contents
of this documentation.

About CORE
----------

This is the official documentation for CORE, the UE4 based game editor built by [Manticore].

A game engine is a complex tool, and it is therefore difficult to present CORE
in a few words. There are however a few things that set us apart:

- **AAA quality on an accessible level.**  For creators this means you can make amazing content at rapid speed, and for
    players it means a wealth of great games at their fingertips.
- **Built-in multiplayer.** This saves creators tons of time and allows for a great interactive experience for players.
- **Social gaming.** A marketplace and community for creators and users alike means everyone is involved in the latest
    and greatest games.
- **Mutually aligned interests.** Manticore is committed to empowering creators and helping players, so everyone is here
    to participate in something truly amazing.

For a more in-depth view of the engine, you are encouraged to read this
documentation further, especially the [Getting Started] section.

Alternatively, check out the list of topics to the left to get started.

About the documentation
-----------------------

This documentation is continuously written, corrected, edited and revamped by
Manticore, as well as members of the community. It is edited via text files in the
[Markdown] markup language and then compiled into a static website/offline document using the
open source [MkDocs] and [ReadTheDocs] tools.

Organization of the documentation
---------------------------------

- The [General] section contains this introduction as well as
  information about the engine, its history, its licensing, authors, etc. It
  also contains the [FAQs].
- The [Getting Started] section is the main purpose of this
  documentation, as it contains all the necessary information on using the
  engine to make games. It includes the [My First Game] tutorial which should be the entry point for all
  new users.
- The [Scripting] section contains is also intended for all users that intend to add gameplay elements, as it contains
  all the information you need to know about scripting in CORE. It includes sections on Lua (including a primer for
  programmers and resources for complete beginners), as well as best practices and debugging tools.
- The [Project Workflow] section shows how to set up the workspace to get the most out of the CORE editor, with
  everything from assets to scripts.
- The [Tutorials] section, on the other hand, can be read as needed,
  in any order. It contains many feature-specific tutorials and documentations.
- The [Community] section points to various community channels
  like Reddit and Discord and contains a list of recommended third-party tutorials
  outside of this documentation.
- Finally, the [Reference] section is the documentation of the CORE API. It is
  generated automatically, therefore the generated files of the documentation are not meant to be modified.

In addition to this documentation you may also want to take a look at the
various [example] projects.

Have fun reading and making games with CORE!
