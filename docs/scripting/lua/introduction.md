# Introduction

Core uses the [Lua] programming language, a lightweight scripting language that allows you to add functionality to Core games.

If you've *used Lua before*

* Feel free to jump straight into the [Core API Documentation] to learn how Lua is used in Core.

If you haven't used Lua specifically, but are *familiar to programming in general*

* Check out the [Primer] we have prepared for you to get quickly acquainted with the details of Lua.

Alternatively, for total beginners, or anyone wanting a step-by-step introduction, check out the [Tutorial], which is up next.
